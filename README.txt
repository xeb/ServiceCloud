The ServiceCloud is a prototype of a custom Service Host with many WCF services.  Each of these services is accessible on their own.  There exists a Gateway service that accepts requests to call any of the ICloudService(s) in a specific order.  This allows you call many WCF services with 1 client call.  

This project is experimental and subject to change.  It is merely offered as a prototype and proof-of-concept for the "Service Cloud"
